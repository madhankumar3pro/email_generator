As discussed, since your app is currently ready and deployed, our first action item will focus on addressing ongoing issues, fixing bugs, and code refactoring to enhance app stability and performance followed by maintenance.\n\n                      Since you've already invested significant time and effort in building and launching the app, the best course of action now is to streamline and optimize the current version before moving forward with new feature development. Our team will understand the current challenges you face and the objectives you are looking to achieve and will start working on the requirements accordingly. Our senior and experienced developers will take care of code review and refactoring, QA, Testing, Documentation, and implementing new features across platforms. Additionally, we have a team of skilled AI/ML developers who will assist in implementing AI features by ensuring compliance with relevant data protection and healthcare regulations.\n\n                      We propose starting with an hourly model arrangement in which you can opt for a 100-hour bucket for which the pricing will be USD 1 million dollars (upfront payment). Once the hours are opted, we will assign an iOS developer, an Android developer, a Backend developer, and a Technical Manager to your project. They will collectively engage with you in a kick-off call to initiate the project, focusing on bug fixes, maintenance, and feature updates.\n\n                      You will have direct access to the team through tools such as Skype, Slack, Basecamp, JIRA, or Asana, depending on your preference. This is going to be a flexible bucket model in which you will have the flexibility of having 1 or more resources working on the same or multiple projects simultaneously. This hourly bucket will have a validity of 2 to 3 months. The working days and times of the resources will be Mon-Fri, 8 hours a day, 10 am to 7 pm Indian Standard Time. Upon completion of the initial 100 hours, you can choose to continue with the same arrangement or transition to a dedicated resource engagement if additional features need to be added to the app.\n\n                      Below I'm sharing some more information about MindInventory and links to the portfolio.\n                      We are a Creative Design Studio and the New Age Digital Transformation Partner specializing in delivering cutting-edge digital solutions that empower businesses to thrive in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape.
